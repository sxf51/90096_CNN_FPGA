# Overnight experiment log

## Events

- 2026-10-11: Started on branch `exp/overnight-1011` at source baseline `1f025dc`. Existing edits to `.gitignore`, both READMEs and untracked report documentation are user work and will not be committed by this task.
- Protected all 46 files under `src/` and `test/` using SHA256, including original source, six parameter files and all golden data. Never run `script.py`.
- Existing `tb_conv1` and `tb_srcnn` print MSE and always return zero; there is no existing numerical threshold. `test/csim.cpp` does not propagate return values. Set14 is disabled by a commented `tb_set14()` call; a new entry point under `exp/tb/` will enable evaluation without touching `test/`.
- External signature is eight float-array parameters: input `[1][255][255]`, weights `[64][1][9][9]`, bias `[64]`, weights `[32][64][1][1]`, bias `[32]`, weights `[1][32][5][5]`, bias `[1]`, output `[1][255][255]`. Parameters are little-endian float32 binary, output/input-channel/kernel-row/kernel-column order. There are 8,032 weights and 97 biases. Input bytes are divided by 255 as float32.
- `.gitignore` admits `hls_config.cfg`, synthesis/simulation/implementation report XML/RPT, `*_csim.log`, and selected HLS run logs throughout `workspace/exp_runs/`. Generated HDL, cache, executables and ordinary logs stay ignored. No changes to existing ignore rules are required. Archived log excerpts will additionally use a tracked `.txt` companion because `experiments/**/csim.log` is ignored.
- Mac has 8 cores and 16 GiB; verified remote Linux host has 12 logical cores, 15 GiB total RAM and about 13.5 GiB available. Choose one synthesis job (8 GiB budget per job); run precision analysis independently. Remote Vitis installation is `/home/lipuze/amdfpga/2026.1/Vitis`.

## Pending Human Decisions / 待人工决策

- Requested Windows Vitis 2026.1 environment is not available from this Mac. The existing project SSH shortcut reaches Linux Vitis 2026.1. Use that verified installation, record OS/tool version in each config and provide Windows settings-batch support in the runner. Windows reproduction remains unverified.
- The supplied Set14 directory contains 13 pairs, with `comic` absent. Evaluate every supplied image and report `image_count=13`; do not describe that as all 14 images or as complete Set14 acceptance. Any final candidate remains provisional until the missing pair is supplied and tested.
- No existing MSE threshold exists. Conservatively require float outputs bit-identical to an independently compiled unchanged golden model under the same compiler settings, while recording MSE against the supplied binary references and six-pixel border MSE separately. No original test or threshold will be altered.
- Existing `calculate_PSNR` converts model output to uint8 without clamping and may wrap outside [0,1]. Use explicitly defined normalized float MSE PSNR (`10 log10(1/MSE)`, no clipping/cropping) for the new precision gate against the same float golden; also preserve original testbench output. Metric choice must be reviewed before claiming external benchmark equivalence.
