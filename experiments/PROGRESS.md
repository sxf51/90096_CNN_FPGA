## Active docs/0005 workstream

WS-0 complete; eight HLS designs passed; two concurrent RTL simulations active under explicit user authorization. F43 registeredConv3 and F46 rasterFIFO cosim run concurrently. W28/F48/C14/F44 waiting workers have been migrated without changing plans or prepared RTL and now use the two-task scheduler. Collect each finished remote archive with --collect-only. F45 featureFIFO32 passed changed-parameter RTL at558758cycles, identical to F97; reduced producer write blocking did not meet the WS-D535741-cycle goal. W25 ROM passed at554226cycles. F43/W28 retain the553171..564345 gate. C13 remains E065-exact on all13 images, with1032DSP/127966LUT/192308FF/263090HLS cycles; C14 must pass before C15 routing. Run W23/W29/W30/C15 and an independent registeredConv3 route after their prerequisites; the prior impossible12.5+2GiB admission is superseded by explicit user authorization for two concurrent tasks. Keep actual memory sampling, newest-task pressure termination at0.5GiB, OOM evidence and serial fallback. F98 board handoff is archived; board measurements remain pending.

See [ROM_CLOCK.md](ROM_CLOCK.md) and [rom_clock_state.json](rom_clock_state.json). Current gates override historical missing-comic/HLS-only/serial-lock wording below: complete course Set14=13; final feasibility=routed; concurrency=explicit two-task scheduling with actual memory telemetry.

Updated 2026-10-12T07:57:42+00:00 from archived measurements.

Branch: `exp/explore-arch`, from phase-one final `2fa7249`. Original46 files and45 first-phase design files remain checksum protected. Preserve user README/.gitignore/docs-index edits.

## Completed

First phase stages0-6 closed in E099. The current complete course Set14 has13 images and final feasibility uses independently routed gates. Historical provisional statuses remain unchanged. No board validation has run.

126 architecture records completed: P01, P02, W01, P03, W02, P04, W03, P05, P06, P07, G01, G02, S01, G03, S02, P10, C01, C02, C03, S03, P11, S04, W07, S05, P12, W04, W05, W06, S06, F01, W10, F02, W11, C08, W12, P08, F03, W08, C09, W09, F08, F16, F17, F18, F19, C04, F04, W13, C07, F13, F05, C12, F06, F14, F07, W17, C05, P09, F09, C06, F15, W18, F10, F20, F11, F21, F22, F12, F23, W14, W15, W16, F24, C10, F25, C11, F80, F81, F82, F83, F84, F85, P13, P14, P15, P16, F86, F87, F88, F89, F26, F27, F94, F31, F92, F28, F93, W19, F29, F30, W20, W21, F96, F95, F97, F98, W22, F34, F32, F33, F38, F35, F36, F37, W24, W26, F41, W27, F42, F47, C13, W25, F40, F39, F45, F46.

Fastest resource-feasible exact frame estimate: [W24](W24_constant_rom_T8/W24.md); 1.7460189000000002ms, T=8, DSP=630.0, BRAM18K=138.0, LUT=53316.0, deltaPSNR=-0.0695141811880653dB. HLS estimates are distinct from route/RTL results.

## Outstanding

Exploration: all required runs archived.

Final verification: W23, F43, F44, W28, W29, W30, F48, C14, C15, F49.

## Weight Loading Workstream

Plan: [docs/0004](../docs/0004-t8-weight-loading-plan.md). Archived. Current gates and next tasks are in docs/0005 and the active block above.

2026-10-12 用户决定降低优先级: F88/F90/F91. F88 was deliberately interrupted with SIGTERM to release the hardware slot; no RTL verdict or measured cycles exist. P14-P16/F86/F87 already completed before the new priority and remain archived. F85/P13 were recovered without rerunning.

Current user decisions supersede the initial WS0 defaults: complete course set=13 images; final resources=routed; ROM=exploratory; scheduling=explicit two-task mode with actual memory telemetry. Runtime parameter interfaces, strict precision and no-push rules remain.

P08 routed DSP48E2 inspection confirms one cell, AMULTSEL=AD and ADREG=1. W10-W13/C07 split transformed-window generation from a fixed16384*(4*T) MAC loop to remove W07's conditional264x264 bound inflation. C08/C09 use independently verified Conv2-only8-bit weights, retain ten-bit activations, and omit coefficient residual repair. Vitis rejects the original8000-bit Conv3 stream at its4096-bit limit; F08-F12/W14-W16/C10-C11 use independent two4000-bit-stream retries with identical arithmetic. F13-F15 isolate Conv3 window rotation and tree-register overhead using F08's measured7013 multiplexer LUT. All new designs are independent; source and paper plans are committed before runs. Re-run CSV analyses, equivalent offline-weight archives and all plots after all evidence arrives. Finalize ARCH_SUMMARY.md, both checksum audits and final F99 commit.

F24 independently rewrites only F23's Conv1 weight-loader indices after its report locates the2.822ns global critical path in a15-bit address multiplier; the dataflow region is2.377ns. Keep T16, quantization and inference fixed, account for nested-load restart overhead, and accept only measured exact/resource-feasible results.

## Recovery

Read ARCH_SUMMARY.md, LOG.md, PHASE2_HANDOFF.md and arch_state.json. Check active local exec sessions and remote processes before resuming pending IDs; completed and active workspaces cannot be overwritten. SSH uses `ssh -F ../ssh-config -o BatchMode=yes xiaoxin-ubuntu`; remote root `/home/lipuze/amdprojects/90096_CNN_FPGA`; Vitis settings `/home/lipuze/amdfpga/2026.1/Vitis/settings64.sh`. The current two-task scheduler uses `.memory_scheduler.json`; recover only provably unlaunched waiting workers with `exp/resume_waiting.py`, and collect completed jobs with `--collect-only`. 60-minute csynth/45-minute issue tuning/six-hour cosim. Local plotting interpreter `workspace/exp_runs/_tools/venv/bin/python`. Never run script.py, modify protected data/designs, push, or substitute predicted results for actual evidence.
