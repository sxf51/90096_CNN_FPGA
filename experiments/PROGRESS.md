## Active docs/0005 workstream

C18 priority completed; T4 closes5ns and verifies1.503160ms IP latency. C18 completes independently at5ns with WNS+0.047ns/WHS+0.031ns,1032DSP/58529LUT/102072FF/109BRAM18K, all route gates passed. Matching C14 RTL300632/300661cycles and C13 all13-image E065 exactness give1.503160ms IP latency, currently fastest. Staged synthesis/report and implementation/report use peak task-tree RSS10.640743/8.169937GiB; minimum available4.822098GiB,70.538872tool minutes. Preserve C15's host failure. Both priority supervisors released at13:32:30UTC and all six waiters resumed; W30 now runs. Finish F50/F51/W31/W30 and C16/C17 all13-image C/HLS, then prepare fresh changed-parameter RTL and staged implementation IDs for screened combinations. Queue final checkpoint paths for C18/F52/W32; W32 requires postroute_physopt. Current routed resources do not require T4 ROM. Keep one heavy plus budgeted light tasks, runtime interfaces and all numerical/physical gates. Stage telemetry lacksSwapTotal; supplementary zram observations cannot establish full-run swap usage. No board results exist.

See [ROM_CLOCK.md](ROM_CLOCK.md) and [rom_clock_state.json](rom_clock_state.json). Current gates override historical missing-comic/HLS-only/serial-lock wording below: complete course Set14=13; final feasibility=routed; concurrency=one heavy task with light jobs admitted by measured headroom.

Updated 2026-10-12T14:06:24+00:00 from archived measurements.

Branch: `exp/explore-arch`, from phase-one final `2fa7249`. Original46 files and45 first-phase design files remain checksum protected. Preserve user README/.gitignore/docs-index edits.

## Completed

First phase stages0-6 closed in E099. The current complete course Set14 has13 images and final feasibility uses independently routed gates. Historical provisional statuses remain unchanged. No board validation has run.

138 architecture records completed: P01, P02, W01, P03, W02, P04, W03, P05, P06, P07, G01, G02, S01, G03, S02, P10, C01, C02, C03, S03, P11, S04, W07, S05, P12, W04, W05, W06, S06, F01, W10, F02, W11, C08, W12, P08, F03, W08, C09, W09, F08, F16, F17, F18, F19, C04, F04, W13, C07, F13, F05, C12, F06, F14, F07, W17, C05, P09, F09, C06, F15, W18, F10, F20, F11, F21, F22, F12, F23, W14, W15, W16, F24, C10, F25, C11, F80, F81, F82, F83, F84, F85, P13, P14, P15, P16, F86, F87, F88, F89, F26, F27, F94, F31, F92, F28, F93, W19, F29, F30, W20, W21, F96, F95, F97, F98, W22, F34, F32, F33, F38, F35, F36, F37, W24, W26, F41, W27, F42, F47, C13, W25, F40, F39, F45, F46, F43, C14, W28, F44, F49, F48, W29, W23, C15, F52, W32, C18.

Fastest resource-feasible exact frame estimate: [W24](W24_constant_rom_T8/W24.md); 1.7460189000000002ms, T=8, DSP=630.0, BRAM18K=138.0, LUT=53316.0, deltaPSNR=-0.0695141811880653dB. HLS estimates are distinct from route/RTL results.

## Outstanding

Exploration: all required runs archived.

Final verification: W30, F50, F51, W31, C16, C17.

## Weight Loading Workstream

Plan: [docs/0004](../docs/0004-t8-weight-loading-plan.md). Archived. Current gates and next tasks are in docs/0005 and the active block above.

2026-10-12 用户决定降低优先级: F88/F90/F91. F88 was deliberately interrupted with SIGTERM to release the hardware slot; no RTL verdict or measured cycles exist. P14-P16/F86/F87 already completed before the new priority and remain archived. F85/P13 were recovered without rerunning.

Current user decisions supersede the initial WS0 defaults: complete course set=13 images; final resources=routed; ROM=exploratory; scheduling=one heavy task with memory-bounded light jobs under docs/0005 section6.1. Runtime parameter interfaces, strict precision and no-push rules remain.

P08 routed DSP48E2 inspection confirms one cell, AMULTSEL=AD and ADREG=1. W10-W13/C07 split transformed-window generation from a fixed16384*(4*T) MAC loop to remove W07's conditional264x264 bound inflation. C08/C09 use independently verified Conv2-only8-bit weights, retain ten-bit activations, and omit coefficient residual repair. Vitis rejects the original8000-bit Conv3 stream at its4096-bit limit; F08-F12/W14-W16/C10-C11 use independent two4000-bit-stream retries with identical arithmetic. F13-F15 isolate Conv3 window rotation and tree-register overhead using F08's measured7013 multiplexer LUT. All new designs are independent; source and paper plans are committed before runs. Re-run CSV analyses, equivalent offline-weight archives and all plots after all evidence arrives. Finalize ARCH_SUMMARY.md, both checksum audits and final F99 commit.

F24 independently rewrites only F23's Conv1 weight-loader indices after its report locates the2.822ns global critical path in a15-bit address multiplier; the dataflow region is2.377ns. Keep T16, quantization and inference fixed, account for nested-load restart overhead, and accept only measured exact/resource-feasible results.

## Recovery

Read ARCH_SUMMARY.md, LOG.md, PHASE2_HANDOFF.md and arch_state.json. Check active local exec sessions and remote processes before resuming pending IDs; completed and active workspaces cannot be overwritten. SSH uses `ssh -F ../ssh-config -o BatchMode=yes xiaoxin-ubuntu`; remote root `/home/lipuze/amdprojects/90096_CNN_FPGA`; Vitis settings `/home/lipuze/amdfpga/2026.1/Vitis/settings64.sh`. The current one-heavy scheduler uses `.memory_scheduler.json`; preserve serial_after_oom=true while old waiting workers exist. Recover only provably unlaunched waiting workers with `exp/resume_waiting.py`, and collect completed jobs with `--collect-only`. 60-minute csynth/45-minute issue tuning/six-hour cosim. Local plotting interpreter `workspace/exp_runs/_tools/venv/bin/python`. Never run script.py, modify protected data/designs, push, or substitute predicted results for actual evidence.
